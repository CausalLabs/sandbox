## Displayed Stats

### Server side

On the server side, this example will output cache stats to the stdout. See the use of `StatsLogger` in [`pages/_app.tsx`](pages/_app.tsx). It will look like similar to this:

> WARNING!: The following features were spuriously cached: ["RatingBox"]. Please make sure your page (route pathname = /overfetch) is not needlessly requesting them in getInitialProps

### Client side

In the Browser, the app stats will be rendered to the html.
